The automated shopping trolley, is a smart trolley which is a companion throughout your shopping time, integrates an arduino with bar code scanner and a battery kit to allow users to self checkout at supermarkets to avoid hazzel free shopping enjoyment. In the modern world every super markets and hypermarkets employ shopping baskets and shopping trolleys in order to aid customers to select and store the products which they intend to purchase. The customers have to drop every product which they like to purchase into the shopping cart and then proceed to check out the billing counter. The billing process is quiet tedious and highly time consuming and has created the need for shops to employ more and more human resources in the billing section and yet waiting time remains considerably high. The tray in which the bar code scanners that are embedded is fitted with a lock and key for which are with  the people at the billing section. This allows users to take out all their products and place them into carry bags during the checkout process so we seem it to propose the "intelligent shopping trolley" which aims to reduce and possibly eliminate the total waiting time of customers, lower the total man power requirement and expenses for markets and increase efficiency overall. In a world where technology is replacing the ways we pursue everyday activity the future of retail industry lies on more and more automated devices
